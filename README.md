The Event Management System is a desktop-based application designed to efficiently manage and coordinate events, specifically for college fests. This system provides an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Java Swing and a robust database management system powered by SQL. The goal is to streamline the process of event creation, participant registration, scheduling, and tracking to ensure smooth execution of multiple events during a fest.

*üéØ Key Features*
1. Event Creation & Management
* Users can create, edit, and delete events.
* Each event includes important details such as:
* Event Name
* Date & Time
* Location/Venue

2. Participant Registration
* Participants can register for events through the system.
* The application securely stores their name, contact details, event preferences, and other relevant information in the database.
* The system ensures that duplicate registrations are avoided.

3Ô∏è. Database Management with SQL
* SQL is used to handle data storage, retrieval, and modification efficiently.
* Key functionalities include:
  Storing event details and participant information.
  Retrieving participant lists for different events.
  Managing event schedules.

4Ô∏è. JDBC Connectivity (Java & SQL Integration)
* The system uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to link the Java application with the SQL database.
* This allows seamless interaction between the front-end (GUI) and the back-end (database).

5Ô∏è. User-friendly Graphical Interface
* Java Swing is used to build an interactive GUI that allows users to:
* Easily navigate event details.
* Register participants via a form-based interface.
* View and manage all event-related information.

*üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used*
* Java (for application logic)
* Java Swing (for GUI)
* SQL Database (for data storage)
