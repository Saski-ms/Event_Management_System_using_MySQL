The Event Management System is a desktop-based application designed to efficiently manage and coordinate events, specifically for college fests. This system provides an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) using Java Swing and a robust database management system powered by SQL. The goal is to streamline the process of event creation, participant registration, scheduling, and tracking to ensure smooth execution of multiple events during a fest.

üéØ Key Features
1Ô∏è‚É£ Event Creation & Management
Users can create, edit, and delete events.

Each event includes important details such as:

Event Name

Date & Time

Location/Venue

Event Description

Events are stored in a SQL database, allowing easy retrieval and modification of event details.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Participant Registration
Participants can register for events through the system.

The application securely stores their name, contact details, event preferences, and other relevant information in the database.

The system ensures that duplicate registrations are avoided.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Database Management with SQL
SQL is used to handle data storage, retrieval, and modification efficiently.

Key functionalities include:

Storing event details and participant information.

Retrieving participant lists for different events.

Managing event schedules.

4Ô∏è‚É£ JDBC Connectivity (Java & SQL Integration)
The system uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to link the Java application with the SQL database.

This allows seamless interaction between the front-end (GUI) and the back-end (database).

5Ô∏è‚É£ User-friendly Graphical Interface
Java Swing is used to build an interactive GUI that allows users to:

Easily navigate event details.

Register participants via a form-based interface.

View and manage all event-related information.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Java (for application logic)

üîç How It Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ Admin/User logs in to the system.
2Ô∏è‚É£ The system allows event creation, modification, and deletion.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Participants register for events, and their details are stored in the database.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Organizers can retrieve participant lists for each event.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Users can access event schedules and track ongoing activities.
